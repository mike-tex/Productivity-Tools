## Installing Git

# Install on Windows
# 1. Download Git bash from https://git-scm.com/
# 2. When asked to choose the default editor for Git, 
#    we recommend choosing nano if you do not already know VIM.
# 3. The "git and optional Unix tools from Windows" option 
#    will allow you to learn Unix from Rstudio, however, 
#    it might interfere with the Windows command line.
# 4. Finally, change the Rstudio preference so that you are 
#    using Git bash as the terminal (only for Windows user)
